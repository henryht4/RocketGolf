ICS 161

Game 1: Rocket Golf Project

*Intro
Game 1 assignment for ICS 161, inspirations from Rocket League and Golf With your Friends. 
Still a little rough, couldn't incorporate everything I wanted. Assets acquired from 
Standard Assets, AxeyWorks(Low Poly Background GameObjects), Lowpoly_Sports_Car_2_In_1.
Couldn't figure out how to get a static variable to keep score between scenes. I have a start menu
however the UI disappears when I start the Game.
