First video game project made for fun to learn Unity 5.5.0. Inspirations from Rocket League and mini golf. 
Still a little rough, couldn't incorporate everything I wanted. Driving physics are not smooth. Assets acquired from 
Standard Assets, AxeyWorks(Low Poly Background GameObjects), Lowpoly_Sports_Car_2_In_1. Download RocketGolf.exe to play.
